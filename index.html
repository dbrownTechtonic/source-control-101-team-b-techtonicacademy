<!-- 
  In this exercise, you will become familiar with the members on your team's strengths and get an idea of what it's like to actually work in an Agile team.  Read the below instructions to complete the project 

    1) Team captain's will create a team for their group , under the "ShockWave" parent team on GitHub and invite all team members to the team.
      a) You may choose a fun name, but keep it professional as these may be visible to Techtonic clients 

    2) The team captain will fork/clone this repository and invite their team to collaborate. 
      
    3) Team Captain will initialize a git flow with "git flow init", accepting all the defualts (Enter until back at root of project)
    
    4) Each team member accept the invite and join your team

    5) Each member will clone the Captain's repository
    
    6) Each team member will create a local feature branch with "git flow feature start [MYFEATURE]"
      a) the branch should be called feature/[YOURNAME]
    
    7) Each team member will complete each section in the index.html file
      a) 3 Strengths
      b) Capstone Idea/Description
      c) Problem solved by the capstone
    
    8) Each team member will commit and push their feature to the remote repo with "git flow feature publish [MYFEATURE]".  Once you have pushed to your branch, submit a pull request/merge request and assign it to someone on your team who has not yet approved a pull request. 
  
    9) Once all pull requests have been approved, test the "develop" branch for functionality (open index.html) and merge it into master
