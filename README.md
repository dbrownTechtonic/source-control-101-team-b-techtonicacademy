# source-control-101

## In this exercise you will get to know your team members and their strengths, and start working in an Agile environment.  

Fork this repository or follow the provided GitHub classroom link (if we've given a GitHub classroom link you won't need to fork) and then clone down the repository to your machine using ```git clone <URL>```


### Here's the workflow we'll use for this project
* The Team's Captain will create a team for your group, under the your class parent team on GitHub and invite all team members.  Feel free to choose a fun name, but keep it professional. 

* The Team's Captain should **fork** and **clone** this repository and invite the team to collaborate

* Either initialize a git flow using ```git flow init``` and accepting the defaults or decide on your team's custom git workflow. 

* Team members should accept the invite and join the team, as well as clone the Captain's repository

* Each team mbmer will create a local feature branch with ```git flow feature start <FEATURE>```.  This new branch should be called ```feature/<YOURNAME>``` (the ```feature/``` is created when you use ```fit flow feature start``` to create a new branch).  

* Each team member should complete all 3 sections in index.html
  * 3 strengths
  * capstone ideas
  * problems solved (for each idea)
  
  
* Now, team members will commit their changes and push their code to the remote repository using ```git flow feature publish <MYFEATURE>```. 

* Once changes have been pushed, submit a **pull request** to merge your feature branch into the **develop** branch and assign it to someone else on your team.  They should review your code, ensure there are no conflicts or problems and then approve the pull request, merging 

* Once all pull requests have been approved, test the **develop** branch for functionality and then merge into **master** and submit your repository link.
